## 🛰️ Description


>  After narrowly escaping the gravitational grip of Gargantua, the USCSS Covenant now drifts powerless. Its reserves are depleted. The main systems have been placed in long-term standby, the crew in cryogenic sleep to conserve what little energy remains.
> 
>  Your only hope: the Tyché, a rescue module built in the earliest days of interstellar exploration. Outfitted with an experimental hyper-entropic propulsion system — a technology abandoned for its unpredictability — the Tyché must reach Mulhiari, a forgotten spaceport, erased from modern star charts.
> 
>  The onboard AI, ATHENA, bound to its original protocols, refuses to initiate the thrust required: by its calculations, it would exhaust the remaining resources and doom the rescue mission.
> 
>  Yet this is your sole chance: to reach the radiation of the dwarf star 55 Glont-Rune, and harness its energy for the journey to Mulhiari.
> 
>  Your only tool: a monitoring console, a relic from an age when quantum physics applied to space travel was still in its infancy.
> 
>  Perhaps a flaw. Perhaps your only way to regain control.
